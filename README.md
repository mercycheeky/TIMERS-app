# Timer App
A simple timer app created using JavaScript that allows users to set a timer for a specific duration and count down to zero.

I created this app as a personal project to improve my JavaScript skills and to solve a problem that I often encounter during work and study. As someone who tends to get lost in their work, I needed a simple tool to help me stay focused and manage my time effectively. This timer app allowed me to practice my coding skills while also creating a useful tool that I can use on a daily basis.

Feel free to use and modify the app for your own needs. Thanks for checking it out!
